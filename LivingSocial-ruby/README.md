Here is a small bit of Selenium testing written in Ruby to test LivingSocial.com

Test1.rb is the only actual test so far, but there are definitely more to come. I'm writing Ruby after a very long time of sticking to other languages, so I'm currently working to improve my Ruby skills.  I'm also 
looking for a good Ruby test framework. I really like Java's JUnit.
